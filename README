Track my business today
I'm a scuba-dive operator and one of the things I'd like to have on my website is a widget that allows people to schedule a class or outing, and pay for it. I don't go out every day and I only have a limited number of people I can take in a class, which means the "widget" would need to keep track of how much availability is there.
